# COMI : Correction of Out-of-focus Microscopic Images by Deep Learning 
   Microscopic images are widely used in scientific research and medical discovery. However, images obtained by low cost microscope are often out-of-focus, resulting poor performance in research and diagnosis. 
   
   We present a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model and a multi-component weighted loss function to address this issue. Our method shows good generalization capabilities across diverse research fields by analyzing various cellular structures ranging from protozoan parasite to nucleus, actin and mitochondria of mammalian cells, demonstrating a great promise for bioimaging. 
  
   The proposed method contains two generators(Source Generator and Target Generator)and two discriminators(Source Discriminator and Target Discriminator). Source Generator translates out-of-focus image to in-focus image and Target Discriminator tries to distinguish real in-focus image and generated in-focus image.Target Generator translates in-focus image to out-of-focus image and Source Discriminator tries to distinguish real out-of-focus image and generated out-of-focus image.
